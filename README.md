# mortgage-dao

As of right now, the name of this repo pretty effectively shows what my plans are for a final project.
I understand that a major component of DAOs is community building and governance, etc- but I'm moreso focused
on building the proof-of-concept for this idea than anything else. As long as I build something that is 
*technically* capable of facilitatinf decentralized mortgage lending- I am more than happy with the outcome
of my efforts. Adoption would be cool, but I think Bitcoin is still a few market cycles away from the level
of stability that is needed to really unlock liquidity from HODLer's bitcoin holdings. 

That said- there will 
be a day where it's reasonable to expect that people will be able to borrow against their BTC in a decentralized
app to make major purchases and investments, etc. This will unlock their equity without parting with their 
precious tokens. This is what MortgageDAO is for.


    Workflow one:

    - Person wants property
    - Person has bitcoin (Bitcoin is the primary target because at time of development, it is most likely to 
    become the most stable CC/long-term store of value, though ETH is ultra-sound too)
    - Person loads bitcoin into smart contract with the DAO
        - Based on the LTV collateralizaiton level, person will get loan at different interest rates
    - Person is sent stablecoin of their choice from DAO treasury to make their purchse/investment
